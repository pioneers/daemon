### Non-Flux part
This is the part of the program that isn't very Flux like.
It's necessary because in a normal Flux program, all actions are
result of interaction
With React components (with actions triggered in components)
Or as the result of asynchronous calls that were initially triggered by calling
Action Creators (and handled inside)
